Along with providing entertainment, movies have been used for reflecting the existance of societal problems. Some even go further and suggest solutions. I watched a Hindi movie today named Guthlee. Here are my reviews on it. I am not trying to convince anyone here, but just recording my state of mind.

The movie describes a societal problem (jAti-bhEd) in a very common way (there are many similar movies) but I feel these don't fit the current Indian timeframe. Let's see why...

The movie shows the problem of bhEda-bhAva in providing education to people of particular cast resulting a mini-rebellion. Although narrated in a heart touching way (and can cause some distress) I believe this is not a **current** major problem because Government already provides free education, Most of the villages have schools and if they don't have, schools in nearby villages provide a free accomodation facility (I have seen this in the school I have studied).

Then what is the major problem you ask? The quality of the work, ones dedication towards the work they do, has reduced. People who joined the workforce either through merit or reservation, upper caste or lower caste are not motivated enough to do their jobs religiously. Police who does the address verification for passport asks for bribe, RTOs need one and half month to just post a license to your address, you can get your college project done for a little money and you can get in to a teaching job by just paying some money.

The current society needs a fight against injustice done to one's duty and I hope movies are made on on this problem in every sector along with some solutions.

**vande mAtaram!**
